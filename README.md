Quasar App for Health homework about Intentional Injuries

Website is found [here](https://redstripez08.github.io/health-homework/)  

## Description
This website was made for homework. 

Most of my experience was in Backend Typescript, so I was
pretty surprised by how fun it was to code this actually. I really enjoyed using the Quasar Vue Framework,
the docs are good and it's pretty easy to understand and work with. At least for me, and I'm not exactly a front-end pro.
This project is mostly Frontend since there is no  server and pretty much all of the code runs client-side (It is a SPA after all).

Might do a Fullstack App soon with a fully fledged server and client. Maybe a PWA if i'm feeling ambitious enough?
